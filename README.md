Connects to Google Sheets using Ballerina.

# Introduction

## What is Google Sheets?

[Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api) is an online spreadsheet that lets users create and format spreadsheets and simultaneously work with other people. It lets us manage spreadsheets, manage worksheets, read, write, update and clear data from worksheets and do column wise, row wise and cell wise operations. The Google Spreadsheet endpoint allows you to access the Google Spreadsheet API Version v4 through Ballerina.

## Key Features of Google Sheets

Read, write, and format data in Sheets. The latest version of the Sheets API lets developers programmatically:

* Manage spreadsheets
* Manage worksheets
* Read and write data to and from worksheets
* Update and clear data from worksheets
* Operate on a range of data in the worksheet
* Operate on data in the worksheet column wise
* Operate on data in the worksheet row wise
* Cell wise operations
* Simultaneously work with other people

## Connector Overview

The Google Spreadsheet Ballerina Connector allows you to access the [Google Spreadsheet API Version v4](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api) through Ballerina. The connector can be used to implement some of the most common use cases of Google Spreadsheets. The connector provides the capability to programmatically manage spreadsheets, manage worksheets, do CRUD operations on worksheets, and do column wise, row wise and cell wise operations through the connector endpoints.

The Google Spreadsheet Ballerina Connector supports spreadsheet management operations like creating a spreadsheet, opening a spreadsheet, listing all the spreadsheets available in a user account, renaming a spreadsheet. It also supports worksheet management operations like getting all the worksheets available in a spreadsheet, opening a worksheet, adding a new worksheet, removing a worksheet and renaming a worksheet. The connector also provides capabilities to handle data level operations like setting, getting and clearing a range of data, inserting columns/rows before and after a given position, creating or updating, getting and deleting columns/rows, setting, getting and clearing cell data, appending a row to a sheet, appending a row to a range of data, appending a cell to a range of data, copying a worksheet to a destination spreadsheet, and clearing worksheets.

# Prerequisites

* Java 11 Installed
Java Development Kit (JDK) with version 11 is required.

* Download the Ballerina [distribution](https://ballerinalang.org/downloads/)
Ballerina Swan Lake Alpha 2 is required.

* Instantiate the connector by giving authentication details in the HTTP client config. The HTTP client config has built-in support for Bearer Token Authentication and OAuth 2.0. Google Spreadsheet uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate and authorize requests. It uses the Direct Token Grant Type. The Google Spreadsheet connector can be minimally instantiated in the HTTP client config using the OAuth 2.0 access token.
    * Access Token 
    ``` 
    sheets:SpreadsheetConfiguration spreadsheetConfig = {
        oauthClientConfig: {
            token: <access token>
        }
    }
    ```

    The Google Spreadsheet connector can also be instantiated in the HTTP client config without the access token using the client ID, client secret, and refresh token.
    * Client ID
    * Client Secret
    * Refresh Token
    * Refresh URL
    ```
    sheets:SpreadsheetConfiguration spreadsheetConfig = {
        oauthClientConfig: {
            clientId: <clientId>,
            clientSecret: <clientSecret>,
            refreshToken: <refreshToken>,
            refreshUrl: <sheets:REFRESH_URL>
        }
    }
    ```


## Obtaining Tokens

1. Visit [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com), click **Create Project**, and follow the wizard to create a new project.
2. Go to **Credentials -> OAuth consent screen**, enter a product name to be shown to users, and click **Save**.
3. On the **Credentials** tab, click **Create credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**. 
4. Select an application type, enter a name for the application, and specify a redirect URI (enter https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground if you want to use 
[OAuth 2.0 playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground) to receive the authorization code and obtain the 
access token and refresh token). 
5. Click **Create**. Your client ID and client secret appear. 
6. In a separate browser window or tab, visit [OAuth 2.0 playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground), select the required Google Spreadsheet scopes, and then click **Authorize APIs**.
7. When you receive your authorization code, click **Exchange authorization code for tokens** to obtain the access token and refresh token.

## Add project configurations file
Add the project configuration file by creating a `Config.toml` configuration file under the root path of the project structure.
This file should have following configurations. Add the token obtained in the previous step to the `Config.toml` configuration file.

#### Config.toml
```ballerina

[ballerinax.googleapis_sheets]
refreshToken = "enter your refresh token here"
clientId = "enter your client id here"
clientSecret = "enter your client secret here"
trustStorePath = "enter a truststore path if required"
trustStorePassword = "enter a truststore password if required"

```

# Quickstart

## Working with GSheets Endpoint Actions

You must follow the following steps in order to obtain the tokens needed for the configuration of the Ballerina Connector.

1. Visit [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com), click **Create Project**, and follow the wizard to create a new project.
2. Go to **Credentials -> OAuth consent screen**, enter a product name to be shown to users, and click **Save**.
3. On the **Credentials** tab, click **Create credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**. 
4. Select an application type, enter a name for the application, and specify a redirect URI (enter https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground if you want to use 
[OAuth 2.0 playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground) to receive the authorization code and obtain the refresh token). 
5. Click **Create**. Your client ID and client secret appear. 
6. In a separate browser window or tab, visit [OAuth 2.0 playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground), select the required Google Spreadsheet scopes, and then click **Authorize APIs**.
7. When you receive your authorization code, click **Exchange authorization code for tokens** to obtain the refresh token.

### Step 1: Import the Google Sheets Ballerina Library
First, import the ballerinax/googleapis_sheets module into the Ballerina project.
```ballerina
import ballerinax/googleapis_sheets as sheets;
```
All the actions return valid response or error. If the action is a success, then the requested resource will be returned. Else error will be returned.

### Step 2: Initialize the Google Sheets Client
In order for you to use the GSheets Endpoint, first you need to create a GSheets Client endpoint.
```ballerina

configurable string refreshToken = ?;
configurable string clientId = ?;
configurable string clientSecret = ?;

sheets:SpreadsheetConfiguration spreadsheetConfig = {
    oauthClientConfig: {
        clientId: clientId,
        clientSecret: clientSecret,
        refreshUrl: sheets:REFRESH_URL,
        refreshToken: refreshToken,
    }
};
 
sheets:Client spreadsheetClient = checkpanic new (spreadsheetConfig);
```
Then the endpoint actions can be invoked as `var response = spreadsheetClient->actionName(arguments)`.

### Step 3: Sample with default truststore
```ballerina
import ballerina/io;
import ballerinax/googleapis_sheets as sheets;

sheets:SpreadsheetConfiguration spreadsheetConfig = {
    oauthClientConfig: {
        clientId: "<CLIENT_ID>",
        clientSecret: "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
        refreshUrl: sheets:REFRESH_URL,
        refreshToken: "<REFRESH_TOKEN>"
    }
};

sheets:Client spreadsheetClient = checkpanic new (spreadsheetConfig);

public function main(string... args) {
    var response = spreadsheetClient->openSpreadsheetById(<spreadsheet-id>);
    if (response is sheets:Spreadsheet) {
        io:println("Spreadsheet Details: ", response);
    } else {
        io:println("Error: ", response);
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Sample with custom truststore
```ballerina
import ballerina/io;
import ballerinax/googleapis_sheets as sheets;

sheets:SpreadsheetConfiguration spreadsheetConfig = {
    oauthClientConfig: {
        clientId: "<CLIENT_ID>",
        clientSecret: "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
        refreshUrl: sheets:REFRESH_URL,
        refreshToken: "<REFRESH_TOKEN>"
    },
    secureSocketConfig: {
        trustStore: {
            path: "<fullQualifiedPathToTrustStore>",
            password: "<truststorePassword>"
        }
    }
};

sheets:Client spreadsheetClient = checkpanic new (spreadsheetConfig);

public function main(string... args) {
    var response = spreadsheetClient->openSpreadsheetById(<spreadsheet-id>);
    if (response is sheets:Spreadsheet) {
        io:println("Spreadsheet Details: ", response);
    } else {
        io:println("Error: ", response);
    }
}
```

## Get, Set and Clear Range in a Worksheet 

This is the simplest scenario to use the Google Spreadsheet ballerina connector to handle data level operations at a given range. We can set, get and clear the values of the given range of cells of the Worksheet with given Name from the Spreadsheet with the given Spreadsheet ID. You must follow the following steps in order to obtain the tokens needed for the configuration of the Ballerina Connector.

1. Visit [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com), click **Create Project**, and follow the wizard to create a new project.
2. Go to **Credentials -> OAuth consent screen**, enter a product name to be shown to users, and click **Save**.
3. On the **Credentials** tab, click **Create credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**. 
4. Select an application type, enter a name for the application, and specify a redirect URI (enter https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground if you want to use 
[OAuth 2.0 playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground) to receive the authorization code and obtain the refresh token). 
5. Click **Create**. Your client ID and client secret appear. 
6. In a separate browser window or tab, visit [OAuth 2.0 playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground), select the required Google Spreadsheet scopes, and then click **Authorize APIs**.
7. When you receive your authorization code, click **Exchange authorization code for tokens** to obtain the refresh token

### Step 1: Import the Google Sheets Ballerina Library
```ballerina
    import ballerinax/googleapis_sheets as sheets;
```
All the actions return valid response or error. If the action is a success, then the requested resource will be returned. Else error will be returned.

### Step 2: Initialize the Google Sheets Client
In order for you to use the GSheets Endpoint, first you need to create a GSheets Client endpoint.
In order for you to use the GSheets Endpoint, first you need to create a GSheets Client endpoint.
```ballerina
sheets:SpreadsheetConfiguration spreadsheetConfig = {
    oauthClientConfig: {
        clientId: "<CLIENT_ID>",
        clientSecret: "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
        refreshUrl: sheets:REFRESH_URL,
        refreshToken: "<REFRESH_TOKEN>"
    }
};
 
sheets:Client spreadsheetClient = checkpanic new (spreadsheetConfig);
```

### Step 3: Create Spreadsheet with given name
We must specify the spreadsheet name as a string parameter to the createSpreadsheet remote operation. This is the basic scenario of creating a new spreadsheet with the name “NewSpreadsheet”. It returns a Spreadsheet record type with all the information related to the spreadsheet created on success and a ballerina error if the operation is unsuccessful.
```ballerina
    string spreadsheetId = "";
    string sheetName = "";
    
    // Create Spreadsheet with given name
    sheets:Spreadsheet|error response = spreadsheetClient->createSpreadsheet("NewSpreadsheet");
    if (response is sheets:Spreadsheet) {
        log:print("Spreadsheet Details: " + response.toString());
        spreadsheetId = response.spreadsheetId;
    } else {
        log:printError("Error: " + response.toString());
    }
```

### Step 4: Add a New Worksheet with given name
We must specify the spreadsheet ID and the name for the new worksheet as string parameters to the addSheet remote operation. Spreadsheet ID is available in the spreadsheet URL "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/" + <spreadsheetId> + "/edit#gid=" + <sheetId>. This is the basic scenario of adding a new worksheet  with the name “NewWorksheet” by the spreadsheet ID which is obtained when creating a new spreadsheet. It returns a Sheet record type with all the information related to the worksheet added on success and a ballerina error if the operation is unsuccessful.
```ballerina
    // Add a New Worksheet with given name to the Spreadsheet with the given Spreadsheet ID
    sheets:Sheet|error sheet = spreadsheetClient->addSheet(spreadsheetId, "NewWorksheet");
    if (sheet is sheets:Sheet) {
        log:print("Sheet Details: " + sheet.toString());
        sheetName = sheet.properties.title;
    } else {
        log:printError("Error: " + sheet.toString());
    }
```

### Step 5: Specify the Range of the values to be entered
We must specify the range as a Range Record type that includes the range as a string representing A1 notation and values to be entered in the range. Here the input array is written row wise to the worksheet.
```ballerina
    string a1Notation = "A1:D5";
    string[][] entries = [
        ["Name", "Score", "Performance", "Average"],
        ["Keetz", "12"],
        ["Niro", "78"],
        ["Nisha", "98"],
        ["Kana", "86"]
    ];
    sheets:Range range = {a1Notation: a1Notation, values: entries};
```

### Step 6: Set Range of Values
We must specify the spreadsheet ID as a string parameter, the name of the required worksheet as a string parameter and the range specified as a Range Record type that includes the A1 notation and values in the range, to the setRange remote operation. Spreadsheet ID and Worksheet ID is available in the spreadsheet URL "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/" + <spreadsheetId> + "/edit#gid=" + <sheetId>. This is the basic scenario of setting the values of the given range of cells of a worksheet with the name obtained when creating a new worksheet and by the spreadsheet ID which is obtained when creating a new spreadsheet. It returns Nil on success and a ballerina error if the operation is unsuccessful.
```ballerina
    // Sets the values of the given range of cells of the Sheet
    error? spreadsheetRes = spreadsheetClient->setRange(spreadsheetId, sheetName, range);
```

### Step 7: Get Range of Values
We must specify the spreadsheet ID as a string parameter, the name of the required worksheet as a string parameter and the range specified in A1 notation, to the getRange remote operation. Spreadsheet ID and Worksheet ID is available in the spreadsheet URL "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/" + <spreadsheetId> + "/edit#gid=" + <sheetId>. This is the basic scenario of getting the values of the given range of cells of a worksheet with the name obtained when creating a new worksheet and by the spreadsheet ID which is obtained when creating a new spreadsheet. It returns a Range Record type that includes the A1 notation and values in the range, on success and a ballerina error if the operation is unsuccessful.
```ballerina
    // Sets the values of the given range of cells of the Sheet
    error? spreadsheetRes = spreadsheetClient->setRange(spreadsheetId, sheetName, range);
    if (spreadsheetRes is ()) {
        // Gets the given range of the Sheet
        sheets:Range|error getValuesResult = spreadsheetClient->getRange(spreadsheetId, sheetName, a1Notation);
        if (getValuesResult is sheets:Range) {
            log:print("Range Details: " + getValuesResult.values.toString());
        } else {
            log:printError("Error: " + getValuesResult.toString());
        }
    } else {
        log:printError("Error: " + spreadsheetRes.toString());
    }
```

### Step 8: Clear Range of Values
We must specify the spreadsheet ID as a string parameter, the name of the required worksheet as a string parameter and the range specified in A1 notation, to the clearRange remote operation. Spreadsheet ID and Worksheet ID is available in the spreadsheet URL "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/" + <spreadsheetId> + "/edit#gid=" + <sheetId>. This is the basic scenario of clearing the values of the given range of cells of a worksheet with the name obtained when creating a new worksheet and by the spreadsheet ID which is obtained when creating a new spreadsheet. It returns Nil on success and a ballerina error if the operation is unsuccessful.
```ballerina
    // Sets the values of the given range of cells of the Sheet
    error? spreadsheetRes = spreadsheetClient->setRange(spreadsheetId, sheetName, range);
    if (spreadsheetRes is ()) {
        // Clears the range of contents, formats, and data validation rules
        error? clear = spreadsheetClient->clearRange(spreadsheetId, sheetName, a1Notation);
        if (clear is ()) {            
            sheets:Range|error openRes = spreadsheetClient->getRange(spreadsheetId, sheetName, a1Notation);
            if (openRes is sheets:Range) {
                log:print("Range Details: " + openRes.values.toString());
            } else {
                log:printError("Error: " + openRes.toString());
            }
        } else {
            log:printError("Error: " + clear.toString());
        }
    } else {
        log:printError("Error: " + spreadsheetRes.toString());
    }
```

        clientId: "<CLIENT_ID>",
        clientSecret: "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
        refreshUrl: sheets:REFRESH_URL,
        refreshToken: "<REFRESH_TOKEN>"
    }
};

sheets:Client spreadsheetClient = checkpanic new (spreadsheetConfig);

public function main() {
    // Create Spreadsheet with given name
    sheets:Spreadsheet|error response = spreadsheetClient->createSpreadsheet("NewSpreadsheet");
    if (response is sheets:Spreadsheet) {
        log:print("Spreadsheet Details: " + response.toString());
    } else {
        log:printError("Error: " + response.toString());
    }
}
```

### Open Spreadsheet by Spreadsheet ID
This section shows how to use the Google Spreadsheet ballerina connector to open a spreadsheet by spreadsheet ID. We must specify the spreadsheet ID as a string parameter to the openSpreadsheetById remote operation. Spreadsheet ID is available in the spreadsheet URL "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/" + <spreadsheetId> + "/edit#gid=0". This is the basic scenario of opening a spreadsheet with the spreadsheet ID obtained when creating a new spreadsheet. It returns a Spreadsheet record type with all the information related to the spreadsheet opened on success and a ballerina error if the operation is unsuccessful.

    }
};

sheets:Client spreadsheetClient = checkpanic new (spreadsheetConfig);

public function main() {
    string spreadsheetId = "";

    // Create Spreadsheet with given name
    sheets:Spreadsheet|error response = spreadsheetClient->createSpreadsheet("NewSpreadsheet");
    if (response is sheets:Spreadsheet) {
        log:print("Spreadsheet Details: " + response.toString());
        spreadsheetId = response.spreadsheetId;
    } else {
        log:printError("Error: " + response.toString());
    }

    // Open Spreadsheet with Spreadsheet ID

        log:printError("Error: " + spreadsheet.toString());
    }
}
```

### Open Spreadsheet by Spreadsheet URL
This section shows how to use the Google Spreadsheet ballerina connector to open a spreadsheet by spreadsheet URL. We must specify the spreadsheet ID as a string parameter to the openSpreadsheetByUrl remote operation. Spreadsheet URL is in the following format "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/" + <spreadsheetId> + "/edit#gid=" + <sheetId>. This is the basic scenario of opening a spreadsheet with the spreadsheet URL obtained when creating a new spreadsheet. It returns a Spreadsheet record type with all the information related to the spreadsheet opened on success and a ballerina error if the operation is unsuccessful.

## Worksheet Management Operations
The Google Spreadsheet Ballerina Connector allows you to access the Google Spreadsheet API Version v4 through Ballerina to handle worksheet management operations like getting all the worksheets available in a spreadsheet, opening a worksheet, adding a new worksheet, removing a worksheet and renaming a worksheet.

### Add Worksheet
This section shows how to use the Google Spreadsheet ballerina connector to add a new worksheet with given name to the spreadsheet with the given spreadsheet ID. We must specify the spreadsheet ID and the name for the new worksheet as string parameters to the addSheet remote operation. Spreadsheet ID is available in the spreadsheet URL "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/" + <spreadsheetId> + "/edit#gid=" + <sheetId>. This is the basic scenario of adding a new worksheet  with the name “NewWorksheet” by the spreadsheet ID which is obtained when creating a new spreadsheet. It returns a Sheet record type with all the information related to the worksheet added on success and a ballerina error if the operation is unsuccessful.

Sample is available at:
https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-googleapis.sheets/blob/master/samples/addSheet.bal

```ballerina
import ballerinax/googleapis_sheets as sheets;
import ballerina/log;

sheets:SpreadsheetConfiguration spreadsheetConfig = {
    oauthClientConfig: {
        clientId: "<CLIENT_ID>",
        clientSecret: "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
        refreshUrl: sheets:REFRESH_URL,
        refreshToken: "<REFRESH_TOKEN>"
    }
};

sheets:Client spreadsheetClient = checkpanic new (spreadsheetConfig);

public function main() {
    string spreadsheetId = "";

    // Create Spreadsheet with given name
    sheets:Spreadsheet|error response = spreadsheetClient->createSpreadsheet("NewSpreadsheet");
    if (response is sheets:Spreadsheet) {
        log:print("Spreadsheet Details: " + response.toString());
        spreadsheetId = response.spreadsheetId;
    } else {
        log:printError("Error: " + response.toString());
    }

    // Add a New Worksheet with given name to the Spreadsheet with the given Spreadsheet ID  
    sheets:Sheet|error sheet = spreadsheetClient->addSheet(spreadsheetId, "NewWorksheet");
    if (sheet is sheets:Sheet) {
        log:print("Sheet Details: " + sheet.toString());
    } else {
        log:printError("Error: " + sheet.toString());
    }
}
```

### Get Worksheet by Name
This section shows how to use the Google Spreadsheet ballerina connector to Get Worksheet with given name from the Spreadsheet with the given Spreadsheet ID. We must specify the spreadsheet ID and the name of the required worksheet as string parameters to the getSheetByName remote operation. Spreadsheet ID is available in the spreadsheet URL "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/" + <spreadsheetId> + "/edit#gid=" + <sheetId>. This is the basic scenario of getting a worksheet  with the name obtained when creating a new worksheet and by the spreadsheet ID which is obtained when creating a new spreadsheet. It returns a Sheet record type with all the information related to the worksheet opened on success and a ballerina error if the operation is unsuccessful.

Sample is available at:
https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-googleapis.sheets/blob/master/samples/getSheetByName.bal

```ballerina
import ballerinax/googleapis_sheets as sheets;
import ballerina/log;

    oauthClientConfig: {
        clientId: "<CLIENT_ID>",
        clientSecret: "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
        refreshUrl: sheets:REFRESH_URL,
        refreshToken: "<REFRESH_TOKEN>"
    }
};

sheets:Client spreadsheetClient = checkpanic new (spreadsheetConfig);

public function main() {
    string spreadsheetId = "";
    string sheetName = "";

    // Create Spreadsheet with given name
    sheets:Spreadsheet|error response = spreadsheetClient->createSpreadsheet("NewSpreadsheet");
    if (response is sheets:Spreadsheet) {
        log:print("Spreadsheet Details: " + response.toString());
        spreadsheetId = response.spreadsheetId;
    } else {
        log:printError("Error: " + response.toString());
    }

    // Add a New Worksheet with given name to the Spreadsheet with the given Spreadsheet ID  
    sheets:Sheet|error sheet = spreadsheetClient->addSheet(spreadsheetId, "NewWorksheet");
    if (sheet is sheets:Sheet) {
        log:print("Sheet Details: " + sheet.toString());
        sheetName = sheet.properties.title;
    } else {
        log:printError("Error: " + sheet.toString());
    }

    // Get Worksheet with given name from the Spreadsheet with the given Spreadsheet ID
    sheets:Sheet|error spreadsheetRes = spreadsheetClient->getSheetByName(spreadsheetId, sheetName);
    if (sheet is sheets:Sheet) {
        log:print("Sheet Details: " + sheet.toString());
    } else {
        log:printError("Error: " + sheet.toString());
    }
}
```

### Rename Worksheet 
This section shows how to use the Google Spreadsheet ballerina connector to Rename Worksheet with given name from the Spreadsheet with the given Spreadsheet ID and Worksheet Name. We must specify the spreadsheet ID, the name of the required worksheet and the new name of the worksheet as string parameters to the renameSheet remote operation. Spreadsheet ID is available in the spreadsheet URL "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/" + <spreadsheetId> + "/edit#gid=" + <sheetId>. This is the basic scenario of renaming a worksheet with the name “RenamedWorksheet” from the name obtained when creating a new worksheet and by the spreadsheet ID which is obtained when creating a new spreadsheet. It returns Nil on success and a ballerina error if the operation is unsuccessful.

Sample is available at:
https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-googleapis.sheets/blob/master/samples/renameSheet.bal

```ballerina
import ballerinax/googleapis_sheets as sheets;
import ballerina/log;

sheets:SpreadsheetConfiguration spreadsheetConfig = {
    oauthClientConfig: {
        clientId: "<CLIENT_ID>",
        clientSecret: "<CLIENT_SECRET>",

    sheets:Sheet|error sheet = spreadsheetClient->addSheet(spreadsheetId, "NewWorksheet");
    if (sheet is sheets:Sheet) {
        log:print("Sheet Details: " + sheet.toString());
        sheetName = sheet.properties.title;
    } else {
        log:printError("Error: " + sheet.toString());
    }

    // Rename Worksheet with given name from the Spreadsheet with the given Spreadsheet ID and Worksheet Name
    error? spreadsheetRes = spreadsheetClient->renameSheet(spreadsheetId, sheetName, "RenamedWorksheet");
    if (spreadsheetRes is ()) {
        var openRes = spreadsheetClient->getSheetByName(spreadsheetId, "RenamedWorksheet");
        if (openRes is sheets:Sheet) {
            log:print("Sheet Details: " + openRes.toString());
        } else {
            log:printError("Error: " + openRes.toString());
        }
    } else {

    }
}
```

### Remove Worksheet by Worksheet ID
This section shows how to use the Google Spreadsheet ballerina connector to Remove Worksheet with given ID from the Spreadsheet with the given Spreadsheet ID. We must specify the spreadsheet ID as a string parameter and the ID of the required worksheet to be removed as an integer parameter to the removeSheet remote operation. Spreadsheet ID and Worksheet ID is available in the spreadsheet URL "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/" + <spreadsheetId> + "/edit#gid=" + <sheetId>. This is the basic scenario of removing a worksheet with the ID obtained when creating a new worksheet and by the spreadsheet ID which is obtained when creating a new spreadsheet. It returns Nil on success and a ballerina error if the operation is unsuccessful.

## Worksheet Service Operations
The Google Spreadsheet Ballerina Connector allows you to access the Google Spreadsheet API Version v4 through Ballerina to handle data level operations like setting, getting and clearing a range of data, inserting columns/rows before and after a given position, creating or updating, getting and deleting columns/rows, setting, getting and clearing cell data, appending a row to a sheet, appending a row to a range of data, appending a cell to a range of data, copying a worksheet to a destination spreadsheet, and clearing worksheets.

### Get, Set and Clear Range
This section shows how to use the Google Spreadsheet ballerina connector to handle data level operations at a given range. We can set, get and clear the values of the given range of cells of the Worksheet with given Name from the Spreadsheet with the given Spreadsheet ID. 

Sample is available at:

```
#### Get Range
To set the values of the given range of cells of the Worksheet, we must specify the spreadsheet ID as a string parameter, the name of the required worksheet as a string parameter and the range specified as a Range Record type that includes the A1 notation and values in the range, to the setRange remote operation. Spreadsheet ID and Worksheet ID is available in the spreadsheet URL "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/" + <spreadsheetId> + "/edit#gid=" + <sheetId>. This is the basic scenario of setting the values of the given range of cells of a worksheet with the name obtained when creating a new worksheet and by the spreadsheet ID which is obtained when creating a new spreadsheet. It returns Nil on success and a ballerina error if the operation is unsuccessful.

#### Set Range
To get the values of the given range of cells of the Worksheet, we must specify the spreadsheet ID as a string parameter, the name of the required worksheet as a string parameter and the range specified in A1 notation, to the getRange remote operation. Spreadsheet ID and Worksheet ID is available in the spreadsheet URL "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/" + <spreadsheetId> + "/edit#gid=" + <sheetId>. This is the basic scenario of getting the values of the given range of cells of a worksheet with the name obtained when creating a new worksheet and by the spreadsheet ID which is obtained when creating a new spreadsheet. It returns a Range Record type that includes the A1 notation and values in the range, on success and a ballerina error if the operation is unsuccessful.

#### Clear Range
To clear the values of the given range of cells of the Worksheet, we must specify the spreadsheet ID as a string parameter, the name of the required worksheet as a string parameter and the range specified in A1 notation, to the clearRange remote operation. Spreadsheet ID and Worksheet ID is available in the spreadsheet URL "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/" + <spreadsheetId> + "/edit#gid=" + <sheetId>. This is the basic scenario of clearing the values of the given range of cells of a worksheet with the name obtained when creating a new worksheet and by the spreadsheet ID which is obtained when creating a new spreadsheet. It returns Nil on success and a ballerina error if the operation is unsuccessful.


### Column Operations
This section shows how to use the Google Spreadsheet ballerina connector to handle data level operations column wise. We can insert columns before and after a given position, create or update, get column values of the given column position, delete columns starting at the given column position of the Worksheet with given ID/Name from the Spreadsheet with the given Spreadsheet ID.

### Append Cell to Range
This section shows how to use the Google Spreadsheet ballerina connector Append a new cell with the given value to the bottom of the range in a Worksheet with given name to the spreadsheet with the given spreadsheet ID. The input range is used to search for existing data and find a "table" within that range. Cell value is appended to the next row of the table, starting with the first column of the table. More information can be found here. We must specify the spreadsheet ID and the name for the new worksheet as string parameters, range as a string in A1 notation and cell value as (int|string|float), to the appendCell remote operation. Spreadsheet ID is available in the spreadsheet URL "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/" + <spreadsheetId> + "/edit#gid=" + <sheetId>. This is the basic scenario of appending a new cell with the given value to the bottom of the range in a Worksheet with the name obtained when creating a new worksheet and by the spreadsheet ID which is obtained when creating a new spreadsheet. It returns Nil on success and a ballerina error if the operation is unsuccessful.
